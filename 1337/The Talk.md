# the facts
- it didn't happen over night 
- ![[Pasted image 20241217030602.png]]
- that is my first order at 2020
- a year and a month later later and this is the highest i ever got paid 95$ a project![[Pasted image 20241217030649.png]]
- in the year of 2020 i did just 85$ ![[Pasted image 20241217031308.png]]
- next year? any thoughts?![[Pasted image 20241217031343.png]]
- yup only 624 dollars, so that is already almost 3 years since dropping out and guess what my family is still right my friends are still right everyone else around me is still right i have failed miserably but what about next year? 
- ![[Pasted image 20241217031446.png]]
- nothing has change 1,192 dollars in a full year i could get a minuim wage job that will pay more than this 1,200 dollars guess what they are still right they are 100% still right i still failed but what wait for it what about the year that follows? ![[Pasted image 20241217031555.png]]
- 6,200 still not that impressive but it is something and this is just fiverr merely a freelancing platforms i have better news that year alone i did almost 20k with payments also outside of fiverr, it doesn't need to take you those 5 tiring years, it doesn't need to be that long for you it could be just couple of months, a year or two but it is a process that requires time and effort to be done but it can be done if it took me almost 5 years with no guidance with no direction it will defenitely take you less, but guess what are they still right yes they are in whatever they say in the short term they will 100% be right now this year i have done nothing so my income is in the minus not even 0 but that is because i have aimed for a way bigger plate and it destroyed me but i m rebuilding it and I am almost certain with توفيق الله that if i get back into this game 10k would be easily managed not a year but a month, but that is something for later on hopefully we can all experience that together for those who stick with this and actually follow along
# The Doubters
First of all, I would like to just inform that all questions are left at the end of the talk, you can note them and if i don't answer them by the end of talk you can go ahead and ask.

## Important Speaking points
- making money online isn't easy, it is not fast and nothing you have heard about, if you have any previous idea about making money just throw it down the drain specially if you have never made money, then any beliefs you have will mostly either trip you or be an obstacle for you and others, and being an obstacle to others is not welcomed in our community not at all, specially beliefs that come from no where "oh you won't make, this won't work" and other things based on what are you making this assumptions, it didn't work for you? well then good cause it didn't work for you cause you did something wrong, doesn't mean it won't work for others and if you believe that it won't totally work for you then you are not welcome again
- You are able to do this *you are curious and you are hard working and you being here is the biggest proof for it*
- Results will differ from a person to another so our goal isn't results it is action that is what we can control
- we believe in providing value and we will go more in depth about what is value cause I don't like words that don't signify anything i like to attach a meaning to those words and therefore provide me with a direct action i can take, for example patience is just figuring out what to do in the meantime i know that might sound stupid at start but when you start taking those words that are taken for granted and give them a meaning things will change
- the only difference between a person who made money online and one who didn't is belief that is it, the belief that it can be done with clear steps with action and consistency
- you will have mentorship along this road at least up to my knowledge limit, and from others so take opportunity cause if there is one thing that i lacked is mentorship a roadmap i had zero guidance and i was just dragging myself into whatever i could do but you will have this, you will have a light at the end of the tunnel someone who already did it with you is here, and you too can do it.
- results will differ some will be extremely successful some will completely fail some will just be average but accept that we are humans we are different and that difference is what makes who we are some of you already tried so therefore have more experience some of you might struggle to even understand english but that is not an issue again what is important is that the only comparison you preform is one with yourself yesterday and today, and that is about you competition is something else of course learn from others look at what they are doing steal like an artist and just help others motivate you to do better not worse.
- this is uncomfortable, this will be weird, cringe but seek discomfort seek getting outside of your bubble you will question and doubt yourself in this journey but always remember it will pay you off it will always pay off if not today if not tomorrow perhaps one day, i m standing here talking to you being afraid perhaps even shacking cause this is not normal for me and that is okay yet we move on and press on that is all you gotta do in this journey
- before moving into the next section i want you to understand that I am being honest and open, I do that to give you a reality of mine that you might relate with if not at least understand that it can be done no matter what, i have done a lot of mistakes in my life and i wouldn't like you to fall in the same pits i did, there is a saying that goes `a man learns either the hard way or the hardest way` be the one who learns the hard one not the hardest the following story might make aware of somethings but you will most likely fall into them but when you do take a moment to stop and ask yourself is this right or wrong, but don't do it the hardest way which is repeating that same mistake 10 times do it the hard way.



```
let us get started who here believes that making money online is a scam is a gimmick is a just a buzz word, or just completely doubts the process of making money online, been scammed or doesn't believe in it completely, anyone? good we have some negative people here, to those type of people by the end of this part if you completely doubt what I am saying then with all due respect I wouldn't like you to be part of this, why you might ask, because you will be a road block for others who truly do for others who truly believe those who have hope that it is possible, but if you can hold yourself from spreading that negativity even if you don't believe then you are welcome please be very open minded in this talk cause this can redefine who you are, you already are breaking the norm but what about breaking it more and more, I didn't want to complete my high school education not because I wasn't able to but because i wanted to prove to everyone that i know that it could be done and indeed i did it even tho i failed it did happen for me with no mentorship with no guidance with nothing but you might have that mentorship you might have that guidance or at least if i am not up to that level you might have a small road map a light at the end of the tunnel which i didn't have at all.
the one thing that lead me to where i m here today it is hope i have knew this school since 2019 and always wanted to come in yet i didn't give up every year after i miss the pool the checkin's and what not i say nah i m done but next year i try to apply again and the biggest testament to what i said is my cousin he was with me throughout the whole journey of just getting to this school and that is just a small point of hope, it is not just fake hope driving by work and curisoity which is something that i see in all of you here, look at your self guys every single person in this room is driving by curiosity and hard work if you don't believe that well you should take another look being here is the biggest indicator of that maybe you are not that committed but you do have it in you, hard work and curiosity is what lead me to dropping out of highschool making my first dollars online and being here, and I am not better than any of you here, if anything most of you are more hardworking than me and I can see it always around me maybe that is just the self doubt kicking in but yeah doesn't matter you passed 30 days of pure hard work you were there you put in the work the hours you have gotten up again and again and again not once not twice, and you were always curious that is what drove you to search about anything you searched about to learn about anything you have learned about I need to understand this and come to peace with it, cause doubt is what is going to kill you in this process if there is one thing that i truly believe will make you successfully in this route is just belief with the combination of the both hard work and curiosity and you will be just unstoppable, but going back to the doubters let me put this in a clear way, you will get scammed you will spend money time and hours and nights dreading about this if you decide to go with it but if there is one thing that i need
Well I see there is couple of you doubters here, i completely agree

# Who Me is?
I Am Abderrahmane El hadji, 21 years old born and raised in saudia arabia and i came to morocco when i was 10 years old tl dr is that i was following the normie path, i was good at my studies but at some point it switched studying only brought me misery pain suffering and nothing good from it, it felt like i was going down a pit-fall at some particular moment somehow i realized that i can do something about it, and that thing is not bound to anyone or anything is just bound to me and my actions, my next decision is to drop out and dropout i did things got worse my family didn't accept it, always shamed me for it said that i m doing the most stupid thing in my life my friends same story, you are going to end up on the streets and be nothing but a bum myb they are right i thought but i doesn't matter i m taking things into my own hand and it started right there i remember my first 5$ i made online it was crazy it was just like damn this could be done that is the first lesson i learned realization vs knowing, might i ask what is the difference between them not the wording but the feeling itself, well we all know we need to workout pray eat well study etc but we don't realize why or perhaps what would that result in, most of you know that you can make money online but you simply don't realize that cause simply you have never made money online you will realize it once you have done it, it is that easy

going back to my story every single day was meet with conflict from my family and friends and to be honest i do understand it, i never blame them cause that is just the norme and i was simply breaking it, what did i think that they were going to welcome me of course not, but it got worse for me my mental health went into a spiral of death the only thing that was holding me is the occasional wins here and there the light at the end of the tunnel which kept me going but ultimately my success was the leading cause for my failure i made money and good money i made there were months where i made 3k averaging about 1k and throughout my 4 years journey i have made roughly 40k, the first 2 years i didn't' even make 2k in total but in the rest of the years i made the rest mostly was done in last year but the plot twist is i lost it all in worthless things, things that didn't matter and never mattered at all, every single time i would make that mistake i would simply repeated and i got to learn the lesson the hardest way let us put it that simply those lessons costed me thousands of dollars but for you they don't know to cost all of that money, it has being almost 9-10 months since i have made any real money and that is just because i stopped believing i thought to myself that this is it, every penny i make just make me sink deeper and deeper and doesn't improve my life or my families in any way, so i gotta stop and that was a mistake in itself not being able to identify that it is not making money that is the issue, it is simply me and my spending habits but it took me a long time to understand that again paying an expensive price for it.

this is all to tell you that no matter what happens you can make it, and you will make it and you will fail you might make mistakes like mine or even worse but ultimately it can be done the question is not wither it can be done or not the question is what will do with it, how will you benefit yourself and others from it and that is about it my story 

now you are wondering what is next what is the idea of this money making club
simply put i want to equip you with the skills to make money understand ultimately how to do it, how to invest it how to actually get something useful from it change your life and the ones near you and in the next and last part i will go through that

# what is next aka what now?

first of all we will focus on services and later on i m going to give a talk on what type of services we can provide, each person will be working on there profile individually we will work mainly on fiverr and upwork is optional but those are the only two options up to phase 3 at least, our ultimate goal is to be able to make 8 services in a specific niche that provide value to the client and as i said all of this is going to be explained later on in more depth, the system will not be forgiving meaning if you don't do the work you are not welcomed in here i only want people that will keep me and themselves accountable if you are not that person or you are not willing to push yourself to be that person you are not welcome here, simply we will have a set deadline for each phase and if that deadline is not met bye bye, *this way* xD you guys get the idea it will mostly be like the 1337 system, there will also be peer evaluation so that you guys learn from each other to see if the minuim requirement is meet to get inspiration if someone is stuck as for the periods for each phase not official yet i m still working on it, and also the goals will be defined later on, we will just start on phase 1 atm cause it is the most important i am also figuring out this thing as we go back tracking what i did and making sure it that it is useful for you guys as well

so simply put this club will have 3-5 to phases that i m still working on
## phase 1
the first phase is branding understanding how you can seperate yourself from others - and make it even in the worse platforms we will be focusing on fiverr and upwork and for you who questions those platforms yes they have low paying clients yes they are bad but not for us why? cause we are different we brand ourselves and we aim for high paying clients, but not at the start the start must be muddy for you to understand what is the market like and later on on phase 4 or 5 we will move out of those platforms and also just a tldr i have made over 25k just from fiverr clients so keep that in mind there is good clients out there you just have to be good for them to find you, in the branding phase you must make videos about your service, a bit about yourself and so on something that will be made completely by you, doesn't matter if you know english, if you know how to film with a camera if you know how to edit as i said this will literally take you from zero
## phase 2
getting out there, after building our branding we will have couple of daily tasks that won't take over 30-60 minutes those tasks will make sure that your services will be seen, improving your services as we move on and also learning more about the services you will be providing, learning customer support and lot of other things i have prepared phase 2 very well because it will be very different for each person depending on the results you get but the goal here is just to be patience which is again 'figuring out what to do in the meantime' we will be expanding our skills, might even work on team projects together and so on this phase is still unclear for me 
## phase 3
this phase is crucial step, here we will mostly likely expand to upwork, to enhance our chances and as i said this really depends on each indivdual results by the end of this phase hopefully everyone would have made 100$ which you must not spend as it will be used for the next 2 phases, every penny you make at the start it is very important to reinvest you are paying 1milllion per year for not knowing how to make 1 million a year so if we can pay for stuff that will accelarrte our growth and knowledge we need make sure to do so just to ensure i m not saying that making 100$ by this step is 100% neccesary cause results will differ some of you might really make 0$ but will learn really important skills but the ones who make wasting that 100$ is not allowed you must keep it to be reinvested not in stocks bonds or etfs but in something far more important yourself but we will learn more about this in phase 4 and 5 hopefully and after those phases things might be even bigger as the ones who survive all of this would really be in a good position to do a lot of things which i will reveal later on, but that is for now thanks a lot for attending this talk if you have any questions please feel free
